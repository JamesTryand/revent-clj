## Event Sourcing 101

Event sourcing is an architectural pattern in which you model your application data, by capturing a
sequence of immutable events. The topic was discussed in length by people like
[Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung), [Udi Dahan](https://twitter.com/UdiDahan),
[Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) and others. It is recommended to study the
benefits and disadvantages of using event sourcing before.
